<h1 style="color:Black;">Why Coding?</h1>

	 
	<p style="color:SteelBlue ;">I was at my wit's end when I decided it was time for me to leave California. As much as I adored being 
	surrounded by loved ones on those breezy, sunny SoCal days - I was in need of a serious plot twist. Like 
	every other student fresh out of high school, I was indecisive about what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. 
	However, I was always certain I'd be doing something related to helping children. Eventually, I decided to 
	major in Anthropology focusing more-so on the Biological perspective. After much deliberation and a brief pep-talk, 
	I convinced myself to pursue medicine. I'm not sure how, but I ran with it. </p>

	<p style="color:SteelBlue ;">Only a few months ago did I come to the realization that medicine just wasn't in the cards for me. Long story short, 
	I interrogated myself. College is already expensive, but did I really even want to pay for med school or be out by
	the time I'm 30? Would this make me genuinely happy? Could I be doing more? So many questions, so little answers. Seemed 
	like too much of a gamble to me and I wasn't willing to take that risk at my own expense. Still, I had to do something
	with my life, and behold, I somehow pulled off a major 360. </p>
	
	<p style="color:SteelBlue ;">Thanks to the Google Gods, I did some researching and was introduced to software engineering. I know I had little to no
	experience, but this was a risk I was willing to take. College is great and all, but I think that many students can agree
	that it limits us to only one path. They neglect to inform students about careers that one woudn't even think
	about pursuing. We hear about careers in medicine, law, business and so forth, but when do we ever hear about computer
	science, marketing or robotics? Basically never. But, I've come to the conclusion that are other ways to contribute to
	the well-being of children outside of medicine. Although my coding is not up to par at the moment, I'm determined to
	follow through with it. </p>
